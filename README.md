# Next.js, MongoDB (Atlas), User Auth, Paypal

Gimme some server-side rendering with minimal set up. ðŸ¤©

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
### .env.example
```
MONGODB_URI=
DB_NAME=
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=
GOOGLE_ID=
GOOGLE_SECRET=
NODE_ENV=development|production
```

To get the tests to pass, you must create a `tests` collection in your database with a resource with a key of `success` set to `true`.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
